# ucsf_gringberg_neuro_images

The goal of this project is to perform segmentation analysis on immunoflourescently labeled neurons on tissue microarrays. The project is in collaboration with the Grinberg Lab at UCSF. 

Three work folders:
1. early_development: computer vision algorithm development using fastai data.
2. ucsf_development : model creation using ucsf training images
3. ucsf_production: implementation of the model into ImageJ, an open-source microscope inspection platform built by the NIH. 

Update 08/27/2019:
Project is in early development. Model backbone selection phase. Awaiting ground truth from Grinberg lab.
